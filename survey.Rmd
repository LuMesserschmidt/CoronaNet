* <span style="color:blue"> Text Entry [...] </span>

<br><br>

### If [entry_type] is an Update on Existing Entry {.tabset}

#### [update_type] 


Please select whether you want to document the end of a policy or document changes to an existing policy.
 
**End of policy** : A policy has ended if it meets one of three conditions:
 
1, The policy is cancelled or annulled
 
2. The qualitative nature of the policy type has changed.

 * E.g. The original policy closed all non-essential businesses but in the change of the policy, personal grooming stores are allowed to open while other non-essential businesses must remain closed.
 * Note, as before, changes in the quantitative nature (i.e. volume) of a policy type stillcount as a change of policy: E.g. the original policy set the restriction of mass gatherings to 100 people and the updated policy restricts it to 15 people would count as a change of policy rather than an end of policy.

3. The geographical target of the policy has changed   	

* E.g. A policy that previously had to be followed by all subnational regions now only applies to some subnational regions  

Note A: Any time (1), (2), or (3) happen, please code choose the "End of a Policy' option below. If the policy meets conditions (2) or (3), please then code the new changes as new entries:   	

* E.g. A policy that previously compelled people to stay in a government facility to quarantine but now changes to allow people to quarantine at home would meet criterion (2). The coder should then (i) document the end of the policy that compels people to stay in a government quarantine as an update to the original policy (ii) document a new policy which allows people to quarantine at home  

Note B: if a policy already has an end date announced with it, you do not additionally have to add an 'End of policy' update for the end date. However, if a policy was originally announced without an end date, and then an end is announced, then please do add an 'End of policy' update to the policy noting the end date.

 **Change of policy**: As before, any changes to any other dimensions of the policy would still count as a 'Change of a policy' rather than an 'End of a policy'.   
 
* These other dimenions are: the 'volume' of a policy,  the 'direction of the policy', the 'travel mechanism' of the policy, the 'compliance' of the policy, the 'enforcer' of the policy, and the timing of the policy 	

* E.g. A policy that compels people wear masks outside but is changed such that wearing masks is only recommended would be a 'change of policy' because the policy type has not changed, only the compliance for the policy has changed.



* <span style="color:blue"> End of Policy </span>
* <span style="color:blue"> Change of Policy </span>

#### [update_level]

#####   If [update_type] is 'Change of Policy' : 

Please identify which aspect of the policy you would like to update. 

* Please answer No, Yes (strenthening), or Yes (relaxing) to all the possible dimensions listed below. Note:'
* 'Yes (strenthening)' refers to either when:
  + More detail is given about a previously vague policy (e.g. originally, the policy was an external restriction on fights from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases and in the update, the government specifies the exact countries they are banning) or;
  + A policy strengthens in terms of its conditions, coverage, or compliance, (see Codebook for examples ) or duration (e.g. a quarantine that lengthens from 14 to 28 days)
* 'Yes (relaxing)' refers to when: A policy relaxes in terms of its conditions, coverage or compliance or expected duration. E.g. schools that were previously closed are now open. 
* Note, it is possible for a policy to strengthen in some dimensions but relax on other dimensions
* Regardless of how many aspects of the policy you want to update (including none of the ones listed below) you will be directed to update the qualitative description of the policy and the date the updated policy was announced, its start date and its end date. Please also make sure to provide the source for your update.
* If something that you want to update is not an available option below,  note that updates only apply to the duration or strength of the original policy, see the CoronaNet Codebook  for more guidance/examples.
If you feel that another option should be given to account for your particular case, please contact one of the PIs on Slack.
* Note you *cannot* change the broader policy type (e.g. Declaration of Emergency, External Border Restrictions) as part of an update.  For the purposes of this survey, we do not consider it an update if a policy changes from External Border Restriction to Social Distancing for example. 
  + However if there is a change in the quantitative nature (volume/'number') of a particular policy, then please choose the option 'The volume of a policy type'  (e.g. the original policy set the restriction of mass gatherings to 100 people and the updated policy restricts it to 15 people).
 + This option applies for: the number of quarantine days, the number of people who are restricted from gathering en mass, and the number of health resources (e.g. masks, ventilators, doctors).

I would like to update ...

#### [notes_update]


Please enter a brief description of the update you want to make for this entry.  Be specific about what part of the event you would like to update and what the update  is:

# Policy Text Description

## [description]
Please provide a description of the government policy you are documenting in the text box below in English. This will be very important as (1) this data forms the raw basis for categorizing different parts of the policy and (2) it can help others quickly understand what the nature of the policy is about so please take your time in entering an thorough but succinct description.
 
Please include the following information in the description:   	

* The name of the country from which a policy originates 
* The date the policy is supposed to take effect (including the year)
* Information about the 'type' of policy (see buttons below) 	
* If applicable, the country or region that a policy is targeted towards 	
* If applicable, the type of people or resources a policy is targeted towards 	
* If applicable, when a policy is slated to end   

Where possible:   

* Copy and paste exact language used for each policy type variable; when necessary, make the language more succinct. 	
* However, if a particular policy applies to multiple targets, keep the original language.   

Example: India “is enforcing a two-week quarantine on all passengers, including Indian nationals arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after Feb. 15, 2020.” --- Keep this sentence as is and don’t extract different target countries for each entry. Note that there is no information on when the policy is slated to end. For more examples of how you should enter into the description, please click on the buttons in the question below and look at the examples for each policy type.  

This [short video](https://youtu.be/O6qPkVK6wew) provides more information on how to write a good description!
